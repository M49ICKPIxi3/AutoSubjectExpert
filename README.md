# StackExchangeRespGen
I'm subbed to a lot of writer's subreddits and frequently encounter many random questions from a wide range of domains. I wondered if there was some way to generate answers for these, and from there guessed that a sort of 'artificial mentor' would be nice to have. This is a proof of concept and could be integrated into a writing app so a user can ask random questions there.

When I saw the list of stackexchanges I further speculated how a fine-tuned model from stackoverflow and other programming related subreddits would work for an interactive dev tool.
